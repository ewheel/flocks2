Introduction:
Our goal is to produce a GUI interface for driving a "game engine" of sorts.  The end result should be as easily extensible 
as possible for different formation types, different behaviors, and dynamic updating of graphical information.  We hope to 
get our flocks recognizing obstacles and responding to them, allowing the mouse to be recognized by the graphics to promote
human interaction with the program, and allowing individual flock members some autonomy from the collective flock.
